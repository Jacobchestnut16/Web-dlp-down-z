- System-wide restructure. This is for updates alone, instead of changes to app.py changes now appear in places like `routes` which is the source of all app functions:
  - all files in `static` and `templates` should now be found inside of the app folder
  - config files are now located in `instance` folder
  - log files are in the `logs` folder
  - the `data` folder houses all the lists .json files
- New features:
  - Styles:
    - Now indexes the `static/css` folder so that drag and drop can work

Before updating change app.py the last line to look like this:
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, use_reloader=False)
