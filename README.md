## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Make sure to set your download path in the `settings` tab default is linux:
- **Windows**:  
  `C:\Users\<your-username>\Downloads`
- **Linux/macOS**:  
  `~/Downloads`

Recommended: leave all `logs` and `files` in their default location. You can move them with the config settings.
- download file is the default downloads list
- playlist file is the default playlist list
- logs are the yt-dlp logs ~ currently not active will contain nothing
- processed are the log files of all downloaded content and all playlists flattened

### Hierarchy
This setting is important for users who want to sort their files automatically. By default this setting is turned off, to enable this enter `true`.
- The hierarchy setting is configured to use `yt-dlp`'s metadata and sort files as follows `download_to/webpage_url_domain/uploader/<files>)`.
  - `download_to` - the location you configured your download locations to go
  - `webpage_url` - the name of the website you are downloading the video from
  - `uploader` - the *creator* or *uploader* of the file your downloading

Future plans for this setting are going to help umbrella videos more:
- Custom tagging: `download_to/tag/`, `download_to/tag/webpage_url`, `download_to/tag/uploader`,  `download_to/tag/webpage_url/uploader`.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Using the Tool ‚Äì Editing Links

Navigate to the `edit` section. Here you'll find groups:
- When you select your group you will see the playlist list by default
- Press 'View Downloadable files' to see the list of download video links

Saving:
- Save will only save the file
- Save and execute will save the file and order you chose then it will execute a flatten or install
  - Flatten: flattens the playlist to the individual links so that you can remove and reorder how its downloaded
  - Install: downloads all of the links in the select download list

Setting install locations:
- Each new group has default install locations:
  - `Playlist` installs to its paired download list
  - `Download` installs to the default location set in the `config file: edit this in the  settings tab`
- Each can be set to install to seperate locations:
  - `Playlist` is required to install to an existing download file
  - `Download` is required to install to an existing directory or folder
> WARNING: Each entry includes a **namespace** (a descriptive name or label). This is for logging and readability only; it does not affect the actual filenames.

## Whats New v2.0.0:

- System-wide restructure. This is for updates alone, instead of changes to app.py changes now appear in places like `routes` which is the source of all app functions:
  - all files in `static` and `templates` should now be found inside of the app folder
  - config files are now located in `instance` folder
  - log files are in the `logs` folder
  - the `data` folder houses all the lists .json files
- New features:
  - Styles:
    - Now indexes the `static/css` folder so that drag and drop can work
  - Cookies:
    - You can now download Private and payed content that you can access from your account
    - use a tool like Cookie editor to copy the cookies. go to `web-dlp-down-z/app/data` add a file call it `cookies.json`
    - not all cookies work to get past these walls, and not all websites work with yt-dlp
