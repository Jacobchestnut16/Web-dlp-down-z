## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Using the Tool ‚Äì Executing Downloads

In the `execute` section, you'll find two processes:

- **process_playlist**:
  - Breaks each playlist URL from the `playlist` file into individual media links.
  - Each item is auto-named in the namespace based on its web link title.
  - Does **not** display a progress bar ‚Äî rely on the log output to check status.
  
- **downloads**:
  - Downloads all individual links listed in the `downloads` file (latest saved version).
  - Displays an ETA and progress bar for each download.
  - Log output shows the progress and completion status.
  - Names all files with the original name
  - Will add in the metadata if provided from the source

## üìÑ Viewing Logs

The `view` section contains log files for both playlist and individual downloads:

- These logs are essential for tracking what has been downloaded or failed.
- **Logs must remain in the project folder** ‚Äî they are hard coded so altering the location will restult in a crash or error.
- Even if a download fails, its attempt is logged.
- You can re-add failed or lost links from the logs back into the `downloads` file as needed (currently this is a failsafe, so you may have to copy and paste).
